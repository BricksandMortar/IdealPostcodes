{"name":"Ideal Postcodes Plugin","tagline":"An Ideal Postcodes Location Service for Rock RMS","body":"### Intro\r\nThis is a location service for [Rock RMS](http://rockrms.com) that verifies, standardises, and geocodes UK addresses using the [Ideal Postcodes](http://ideal-postcodes.co.uk) API.\r\n\r\nThe repository includes the C# source for use with the [Rockit SDK](http://www.rockrms.com/Rock/Developer). \r\nTo download the latest release of the plugin in .dll format click [here](https://github.com/arranf/IdealPostcodesLocationService/releases/latest).\r\n\r\n### A Quick Explanation\r\nThis location service will pass the values (if any are present) of the address line 1, address line 2, city, state, and postal code fields from Rock to Ideal Postcodes. It will then ask for the best match and if values are present in the response it will replace the values stored in Rock with the response values.\r\n\r\nThe matching is as follows\r\n\r\nRock Field | Ideal Postcodes Data Source\r\n---- | ----\r\nAddress 1 | Address Line 1\r\nAddress 2 | Address Line 2\r\nCity | Post Town (Lowercase)\r\nState | County\r\n\r\n**Note:**\r\nThe use of the county address line was deprecated in 1996 and as a result not every request will return a matching county field. For example, 10 Downing Street does not have a county according to PAF data. \r\n\r\nIdeal Postcodes uses three sources for county data. \r\n>Normally, the postal county is returned. If this is not present, the county field will fall back to the administrative county. If the administrative county is also not present, the county field will fall back to the traditional county\r\n\r\nIdeal Postcodes will also geocode addresses using ONS and Ordanance Survey data. This information updates roughly quarterly so in certain situations information may not be available.\r\n\r\n### Closing\r\nIf anything looks broken, flag up an issue. \r\n\r\nThis project is licensed under the [Apache 2.0 License](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
