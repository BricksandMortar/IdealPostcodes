{"name":"Rock Ideal Postcodes Location Service","tagline":"Ideal Postcodes Location Service for Rock","body":"# Rock Ideal Postcodes Location Service\r\n\r\n### Intro\r\nThis is a location service for [Rock](http://rockrms.com) that verifies, standardises, and geocodes UK addresses using the [Ideal Postcodes](http://ideal-postcodes.co.uk) API.\r\n\r\nThe repository includes the Visual Studio solution for use with the [Rockit SDK](http://www.rockrms.com/Rock/Developer) and also the .dll file that will be packaged as a Rock Store plugin when the Rock Store becomes available.\r\n\r\nTo download the 1.0 release of the plugin click [here](https://github.com/arranf/RockIdealPostcodesLocationServicePlugin/releases/download/v1.0/Rock-IdealPostcodesLocationService-1.0.zip).\r\n\r\n### A Quick Explanation\r\nThis location service will pass the values (if any are present) of the address line 1, address line 2, city, state, and ZIP code fields from Rock to Ideal Postcodes. It will then ask for the best match and where values are present in the response, replace the values stored in Rock with the response values.\r\n\r\n<b>Note:</b>\r\nThe use of the county address line was deprecated in 1996 and as a result not every request will return a matching county field. For example, 10 Downing Street does not have a county according to PAF data. \r\n\r\nAs a result I've decided to pass the administrative district data from the ONS if no county data is present. I may put a toggle on this behaviour in a future release.\r\n\r\n### Closing\r\nIf anything looks broken, flag up an issue. \r\n\r\nThis project is licensed under the [Apache 2.0 License](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
