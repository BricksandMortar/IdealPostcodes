# A Quick Explanation
The plugin checks to see if there is any information in line 1 or line 2 of the address. If there is then the plugin passes the full address information from Rock to Ideal Postcodes. It will then ask for their best match and replace the exisiting information with the new information from Ideal Postcodes.

The matching is as follows

Rock Field | Ideal Postcodes Data Source
---- | ----
Address 1 | Address Line 1
Address 2 | Address Line 2
City | Post Town
State | County
