  <p>To use this plugin you will need a <a href="https://ideal-postcodes.co.uk/">Ideal Postcodes account</a>. You can setup without payment with just an email address and password.</p>
  <p>When you've created a new account you will be prompted to create a new API key, which will come with 15 free lookups to test the service. Before you are able to use the service, and your new API key, you will need to authorise your account.
    Once you have authorised your account you should see a confirmation screen (as shown below).

    <h2 id="rock-sub-section">Rock</h2>

    <p>Configuring your Rock instance to use Ideal Postcodes is easy. There are <strong>two</strong> simple changes that have to made. Firstly, visit <span data-type="action">Admin Tools > General Settings > Global Attributes</span> and set the <span data-type="action">Support International Addresses</span> value to <span data-type="action">Yes</span>. Secondly, visit <span data-type="action">Admin Tools > System Settings > Location Services</span> and select <span data-type="action">Ideal Postcodes</span> and change the service to <span data-type="action">Active</span> and paste the API key you generated in the previous step into the <span data-type="action">API Key</span> field. Your API key should begin with the prefix "ak_".

      <h1 id="pluginfunction" class="page-header">How the Plugin Functions</h1>
      This location service will pass the values (if any are present) of the address line 1, address line 2, city, state, and postal code fields from Rock to Ideal Postcodes. It will then ask for the best match and if values are present in the response it will replace the values stored in Rock with the response values.

      The matching is as follows
      <table class="table table-bordered">
        <tr>
          <th>Rock Field</th>
          <th>Ideal Postcodes Data Source</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Address 1</td>
          <td>Address Line 1</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Address 2</td>
          <td>Address Line 2</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>City</td>
          <td>Post Town (as lowercase)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>State</td>
          <td>County</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <h3 id="counties-sub-section">A Note on Counties</h3>
      <p>The use of the county address line was deprecated in 1996 and as a result not every request will return a matching county field. For example, 10 Downing Street does not have a county according to PAF data.</p>
